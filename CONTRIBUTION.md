## Introduction

WanderLust is an open-source travel experience sharing platform that allows users to explore destinations, share their travel stories, and connect with fellow travelers. As part of GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC) 2025, we're committed to fostering a collaborative environment where contributors of all skill levels can learn, grow, and make meaningful contributions.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to WanderLust:

- **Code Contributions**: Fix bugs, add new features, or improve existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve README, write tutorials, or create API documentation
- **Testing**: Write unit tests, integration tests, or help with QA
- **Design**: Improve UI/UX, create new designs, or enhance user experience
- **Bug Reports**: Report issues and help us identify problems
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new features or improvements
- **Community Support**: Help answer questions from other contributors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.0.0 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/WanderLust.git
cd WanderLust
```

3. Add the upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/koushik369mondal/WanderLust.git
```

## Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

1. Copy the environment template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Set up the required environment variables (refer to README.md for detailed setup):
   - Cloudinary credentials for image uploads
   - Mapbox API token for maps
   - MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - Session secret

### 3. Database Setup

The application uses MongoDB. You can either:

- Use MongoDB Atlas (cloud) - recommended for development
- Install MongoDB locally

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Development mode (auto-restart on changes)
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### 5. Initialize Database (Optional)

If you want to populate the database with sample data:

```bash
node init/index.js
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Branch Naming Convention

When creating branches for your contributions, use the following naming convention:

- `feature/description-of-feature` - for new features
- `bugfix/description-of-bug` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description-of-docs` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description-of-refactor` - for code refactoring
- `test/description-of-test` - for adding tests

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-user-profile-page
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, concise commit messages that follow this format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system"
git commit -m "fix: resolve map loading issue on mobile devices"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
```
